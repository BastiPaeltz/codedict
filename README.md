# codedict

#### A command-line dictionary for the developer who likes it organized.

## What is it?

**codedict** is a little command line tool designed to be your personal dictionary for programming / developing. It is entirely up to you how to organize and arrange it. Lightweight, locally stored and easy to use, you can create your own *reference*, *documentation* or *dictionary* for development with codedict.
